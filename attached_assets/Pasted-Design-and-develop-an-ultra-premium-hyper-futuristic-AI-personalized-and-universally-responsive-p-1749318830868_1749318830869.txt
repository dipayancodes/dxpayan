Design and develop an ultra-premium, hyper-futuristic, AI-personalized, and universally responsive portfolio website for **Dipayan Ghosh** — a crypto trader, data scientist, entrepreneur, and full-stack developer — that functions as an immersive digital identity and high-end personal brand. The site must embody cinematic luxury and cutting-edge technology, merging **dark mode aesthetics**, **neon-gradient accents**, **glassmorphism**, **3D visuals** via **Three.js or Spline**, and **AI-driven personalization** to deliver a bespoke user experience. The entire UI must be visually striking and functionally intuitive, using **Next.js (App Router)**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Framer Motion**, and responsive breakpoints that render flawlessly across **smartphones**, **tablets**, **4K/ultrawide monitors**, and **foldable/detachable devices**, with pixel-perfect scaling, fluid typography (`clamp()`), and scalable icons (Lucide/FontAwesome). The homepage should feature a full-screen animated hero section with a real-time **WebGL blockchain network or data stream**, kinetic text introducing Dipayan (“I trade coins, decode data, and build the future”), and CTA buttons for exploring his work or initiating contact. Behind this, an **ambient ambient synth soundtrack** with toggle and soft motion-linked lighting will evoke depth and modernity. Include a preloader with Dipayan’s animated logo and a dynamic favicon.

The **About Me** section should feature a vertical timeline highlighting Dipayan’s milestones (key trades, startups, tech builds), a responsive glowing 3D avatar or silhouette, and animated skill chips (e.g., `Solana`, `Binance API`, `Pandas`, `TensorFlow`, `MongoDB`, `React`, `Node.js`, `Rust`, `PostgreSQL`) with hover-pulses. The **Persona Section** must have four animated cards (Developer, Trader, Scientist, Entrepreneur), each expanding into cinematic modals with short videos, animated dashboards (e.g., TradingView charts), live code embeds, or case studies with GPT-based voiceovers. The **Projects Gallery** should be a scrollable, filterable masonry layout with animated hover states, lightbox modals showing code, architecture diagrams, tech stacks, deployment links, project goals, and ROI impact where applicable. The **Live Crypto Insights** section should embed a real-time TradingView widget showing Dipayan’s selected assets (e.g., SOL, ETH, BTC), recent trades, heat maps, and a mini dashboard for strategy snapshots — all styled within transparent UI containers. Optionally, add a **GPT-4-powered assistant** that lives in the corner of the site, capable of answering portfolio questions, guiding navigation, or scheduling meetings via connected calendars.

The **Contact & CTA** section should be a full-screen form on a frosted-glass panel with glowing edges, auto-validation, animated input fields, and integrated with Supabase or Firebase for backend form handling. Social links (Discord, GitHub, Telegram, Twitter, Email) must animate on hover and sit within a fixed footer or slide-out panel. Optional integrations: **GitHub API** (to pull real-time commits/projects), **Twitter API** (to show recent tweets), and **OpenAI API** (to personalize the content per returning users). Site must be fully **accessible** (ARIA tags, screen reader ready, keyboard nav), **SEO optimized** with structured schema, **lazy-loaded assets**, **pre-rendered routes**, and performance-tuned to pass **Core Web Vitals**. Add a scroll-based progress bar, a floating nav menu, cursor trail interactivity, and immersive transitions between sections (e.g., parallax scenes, fading layer changes, sliding panels). The entire portfolio should feel like an interactive **digital vault** — intelligent, refined, and alive — positioning Dipayan Ghosh as a visionary force in AI, crypto, and digital innovation ecosystems, capable of building, predicting, and inspiring the future.
