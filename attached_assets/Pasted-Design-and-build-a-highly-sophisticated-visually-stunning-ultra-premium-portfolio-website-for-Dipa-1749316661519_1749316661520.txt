Design and build a highly sophisticated, visually stunning, ultra-premium portfolio website for Dipayan Ghosh, who is a multi-disciplinary professional — a crypto trader, data scientist, entrepreneur, and full-stack web developer. The website must reflect futuristic luxury and technical brilliance, merging the aesthetics of brands like Apple, Tesla, and Binance, with the dynamic functionality of next-gen web platforms. The theme should be dark mode, infused with neon gradients, glassmorphism, and motion-reactive visuals. Use ambient background animations powered by WebGL (Three.js or Spline) to render a continuously evolving digital environment — think slow, glowing graphs, floating crypto logos, or particle-based constellations that represent data streams and blockchain nodes. The landing hero section should immediately capture attention with an elegant animated tagline like: "Hi, I’m Dipayan — I trade coins, build products, and decode data to drive innovation." Include a subtle ambient sound layer (with user control), cinematic text transitions using GSAP, and a full-screen background of slowly morphing data grids or real-time crypto price visualizations.

The "About Me" section should blend a personal timeline (highlighting key milestones in trading, building, and data science) with a responsive 3D avatar or stylized photo embedded in a glassmorphic frame. Add glowing, animated tech-skill tags that pulse as the user hovers — tags like React, Node.js, TensorFlow, Pandas, Binance API, Solana, MongoDB, etc. The "What I Do" section should feature interactive cards or panels, each representing a persona: 👨‍💻 Developer, 📊 Data Scientist, 📈 Trader, 🚀 Entrepreneur. On hover or click, each card should expand into an immersive modal with live charts, code snippets, trading dashboards, or even short explainer videos. The "Projects" area should be a dynamic grid — filterable by tech stack or industry — with elegant hover zoom effects, GIF previews, and modals showing GitHub links, live demos, technologies used, and project impact.

Include a live TradingView widget embedded in a separate "Market Insights" section, showcasing real-time crypto trends, possibly personalized with Dipayan’s favorite tokens and technical indicators. Add optional integration with Twitter API to show real-time tweets/threads from Dipayan's handle or a curated list of top crypto voices. For the Contact page, use a fullscreen form with glassmorphic panels, floating glowing borders, and a responsive map with subtle dark blur. Allow connections via LinkedIn, GitHub, Telegram, Discord, and email.

Tech stack must be bleeding-edge: use Next.js (with App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and optionally Three.js or Spline for 3D content. Backend can be Firebase, Supabase, or a custom Node.js API if needed. Ensure smooth transitions, blazing-fast performance (use lazy loading, image optimization), and responsive design on all devices. Add subtle accessibility features (keyboard nav, alt-text, light/dark toggle). Add a floating navigation menu, scroll progress indicator, and immersive transitions between sections (like cinematic crossfades or sliding panels). The entire experience should feel like stepping into a personal digital vault — rich with intelligence, precision, and luxury — tailored to attract investors, partners, hiring managers, or elite collaborators in web3, AI, and tech innovation.
